//! Shareable mutable containers.
//!
//! Values of the `Cell<T>` and `RefCell<T>` types may be mutated through shared references (i.e.
//! the common `&T` type), whereas most Rust types can only be mutated through unique (`&mut T`)
//! references. We say that `Cell<T>` and `RefCell<T>` provide 'interior mutability', in contrast
//! with typical Rust types that exhibit 'inherited mutability'.
//!
//! Cell types come in two flavors: `Cell<T>` and `RefCell<T>`. `Cell<T>` provides `get` and `set`
//! methods that change the interior value with a single method call. `Cell<T>` though is only
//! compatible with types that implement `Copy`. For other types, one must use the `RefCell<T>`
//! type, acquiring a write lock before mutating.
//!
//! `RefCell<T>` uses Rust's lifetimes to implement 'dynamic borrowing', a process whereby one can
//! claim temporary, exclusive, mutable access to the inner value. Borrows for `RefCell<T>`s are
//! tracked 'at runtime', unlike Rust's native reference types which are entirely tracked
//! statically, at compile time. Because `RefCell<T>` borrows are dynamic it is possible to attempt
//! to borrow a value that is already mutably borrowed; when this happens it results in task panic.
//!
//! # When to choose interior mutability
//!
//! The more common inherited mutability, where one must have unique access to mutate a value, is
//! one of the key language elements that enables Rust to reason strongly about pointer aliasing,
//! statically preventing crash bugs. Because of that, inherited mutability is preferred, and
//! interior mutability is something of a last resort. Since cell types enable mutation where it
//! would otherwise be disallowed though, there are occasions when interior mutability might be
//! appropriate, or even *must* be used, e.g.
//!
//! * Introducing inherited mutability roots to shared types.
//! * Implementation details of logically-immutable methods.
//! * Mutating implementations of `clone`.
//!
//! ## Introducing inherited mutability roots to shared types
//!
//! Shared smart pointer types, including `Rc<T>` and `Arc<T>`, provide containers that can be
//! cloned and shared between multiple parties. Because the contained values may be
//! multiply-aliased, they can only be borrowed as shared references, not mutable references.
//! Without cells it would be impossible to mutate data inside of shared boxes at all!
//!
//! It's very common then to put a `RefCell<T>` inside shared pointer types to reintroduce
//! mutability:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::collections::HashMap;
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let shared_map: Rc<RefCell<_>> = Rc::new(RefCell::new(HashMap::new()));
//!     shared_map.borrow_mut().insert("africa", 92388);
//!     shared_map.borrow_mut().insert("kyoto", 11837);
//!     shared_map.borrow_mut().insert("piccadilly", 11826);
//!     shared_map.borrow_mut().insert("marbles", 38);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that this example uses `Rc<T>` and not `Arc<T>`. `RefCell<T>`s are for single-threaded
//! scenarios. Consider using `Mutex<T>` if you need shared mutability in a multi-threaded
//! situation.
//!
//! ## Implementation details of logically-immutable methods
//!
//! Occasionally it may be desirable not to expose in an API that there is mutation happening
//! "under the hood". This may be because logically the operation is immutable, but e.g. caching
//! forces the implementation to perform mutation; or because you must employ mutation to implement
//! a trait method that was originally defined to take `&self`.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//!
//! struct Graph {
//!     edges: Vec<(i32, i32)>,
//!     span_tree_cache: RefCell<Option<Vec<(i32, i32)>>>
//! }
//!
//! impl Graph {
//!     fn minimum_spanning_tree(&self) -> Vec<(i32, i32)> {
//!         // Create a new scope to contain the lifetime of the
//!         // dynamic borrow
//!         {
//!             // Take a reference to the inside of cache cell
//!             let mut cache = self.span_tree_cache.borrow_mut();
//!             if cache.is_some() {
//!                 return cache.as_ref().unwrap().clone();
//!             }
//!
//!             let span_tree = self.calc_span_tree();
//!             *cache = Some(span_tree);
//!         }
//!
//!         // Recursive call to return the just-cached value.
//!         // Note that if we had not let the previous borrow
//!         // of the cache fall out of scope then the subsequent
//!         // recursive borrow would cause a dynamic task panic.
//!         // This is the major hazard of using `RefCell`.
//!         self.minimum_spanning_tree()
//!     }
//! #   fn calc_span_tree(&self) -> Vec<(i32, i32)> { vec![] }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Mutating implementations of `clone`
//!
//! This is simply a special - but common - case of the previous: hiding mutability for operations
//! that appear to be immutable. The `clone` method is expected to not change the source value, and
//! is declared to take `&self`, not `&mut self`. Therefore any mutation that happens in the
//! `clone` method must use cell types. For example, `Rc<T>` maintains its reference counts within a
//! `Cell<T>`.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::cell::Cell;
//!
//! struct Rc<T> {
//!     ptr: *mut RcBox<T>
//! }
//!
//! struct RcBox<T> {
//!     value: T,
//!     refcount: Cell<usize>
//! }
//!
//! impl<T> Clone for Rc<T> {
//!     fn clone(&self) -> Rc<T> {
//!         unsafe {
//!             (*self.ptr).refcount.set((*self.ptr).refcount.get() + 1);
//!             Rc { ptr: self.ptr }
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
