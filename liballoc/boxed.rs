//! A pointer type for heap allocation.
//!
//! `Box<T>`, casually referred to as a 'box', provides the simplest form of heap allocation in
//! Rust. Boxes provide ownership for this allocation, and drop their contents when they go out of
//! scope.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Creating a box:
//!
//! ```
//! let x = Box::new(5);
//! ```
//!
//! Creating a recursive data structure:
//!
//! ```
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! enum List<T> {
//!     Cons(T, Box<List<T>>),
//!     Nil,
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let list: List<i32> = List::Cons(1, Box::new(List::Cons(2, Box::new(List::Nil))));
//!     println!("{:?}", list);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This will print `Cons(1, Cons(2, Nil))`.
//!
//! Recursive structures must be boxed, because if the definition of `Cons` looked like this:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! Cons(T, List<T>),
//! ```
//!
//! It wouldn't work. This is because the size of a `List` depends on how many elements are in the
//! list, and so we don't know how much memory to allocate for a `Cons`. By introducing a `Box`,
//! which has a defined size, we know how big `Cons` needs to be.

/// `FnBox` is a version of the `FnOnce` intended for use with boxed

/// closures become directly usable.)

/// ### Example
///
/// Here is a snippet of code which creates a hashmap full of boxed
/// once closures and then removes them one by one, calling each
/// closure as it is removed. Note that the type of the closures
/// stored in the map is `Box<FnBox() -> i32>` and not `Box<FnOnce()
/// -> i32>`.
