/// A low-level utility for more ergonomically allocating, reallocating, and deallocating a
/// a buffer of memory on the heap without having to worry about all the corner cases
/// involved. This type is excellent for building your own data structures like Vec and VecDeque.
/// In particular:
///
/// * Produces heap::EMPTY on zero-sized types
/// * Produces heap::EMPTY on zero-length allocations
/// * Catches all overflows in capacity computations (promotes them to "capacity overflow" panics)
/// * Guards against 32-bit systems allocating more than isize::MAX bytes
/// * Guards against overflowing your length
/// * Aborts on OOM
/// * Avoids freeing heap::EMPTY
/// * Contains a ptr::Unique and thus endows the user with all related benefits
///
/// This type does not in anyway inspect the memory that it manages. When dropped it *will*
/// free its memory, but it *won't* try to Drop its contents. It is up to the user of RawVec
/// to handle the actual things *stored* inside of a RawVec.
///
/// Note that a RawVec always forces its capacity to be usize::MAX for zero-sized types.
/// This enables you to use capacity growing logic catch the overflows in your length
/// that might occur with zero-sized types.
///
/// However this means that you need to be careful when roundtripping this type
/// with a `Box<[T]>`: `cap()` won't yield the len. However `with_capacity`,
/// `shrink_to_fit`, and `from_box` will actually set RawVec's private capacity
/// field. This allows zero-sized types to not be special-cased by consumers of
/// this type.
