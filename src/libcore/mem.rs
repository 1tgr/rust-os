/// Leaks a value: takes ownership and "forgets" about the value **without running
/// its destructor**.
///
/// Any resources the value manages, such as heap memory or a file handle, will linger
/// forever in an unreachable state.
///
/// If you want to dispose of a value properly, running its destructor, see
/// [`mem::drop`][drop].
///
/// # Safety
///
/// `forget` is not marked as `unsafe`, because Rust's safety guarantees
/// do not include a guarantee that destructors will always run. For example,
/// a program can create a reference cycle using [`Rc`][rc], or call
/// [`process:exit`][exit] to exit without running destructors. Thus, allowing
/// `mem::forget` from safe code does not fundamentally change Rust's safety
/// guarantees.
///
/// That said, leaking resources such as memory or I/O objects is usually undesirable,
/// so `forget` is only recommended for specialized use cases like those shown below.
///
/// Because forgetting a value is allowed, any `unsafe` code you write must
/// allow for this possibility. You cannot return a value and expect that the
/// caller will necessarily run the value's destructor.
///
/// [rc]: ../../std/rc/struct.Rc.html
/// [exit]: ../../std/process/fn.exit.html
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Leak some heap memory by never deallocating it:
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem;
///
/// let heap_memory = Box::new(3);
/// mem::forget(heap_memory);
/// ```
///
/// Leak an I/O object, never closing the file:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::mem;
/// use std::fs::File;
///
/// let file = File::open("foo.txt").unwrap();
/// mem::forget(file);
/// ```
///
/// The practical use cases for `forget` are rather specialized and mainly come
/// up in unsafe or FFI code.
///
/// ## Use case 1
///
/// You have created an uninitialized value using [`mem::uninitialized`][uninit].
/// You must either initialize or `forget` it on every computation path before
/// Rust drops it automatically, like at the end of a scope or after a panic.
/// Running the destructor on an uninitialized value would be [undefined behavior][ub].
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem;
/// use std::ptr;
///
/// # let some_condition = false;
/// unsafe {
///     let mut uninit_vec: Vec<u32> = mem::uninitialized();
///
///     if some_condition {
///         // Initialize the variable.
///         ptr::write(&mut uninit_vec, Vec::new());
///     } else {
///         // Forget the uninitialized value so its destructor doesn't run.
///         mem::forget(uninit_vec);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Use case 2
///
/// You have duplicated the bytes making up a value, without doing a proper
/// [`Clone`][clone]. You need the value's destructor to run only once,
/// because a double `free` is undefined behavior.
///
/// An example is the definition of [`mem::swap`][swap] in this module:
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem;
/// use std::ptr;
///
/// # #[allow(dead_code)]
/// fn swap<T>(x: &mut T, y: &mut T) {
///     unsafe {
///         // Give ourselves some scratch space to work with
///         let mut t: T = mem::uninitialized();
///
///         // Perform the swap, `&mut` pointers never alias
///         ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(&*x, &mut t, 1);
///         ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(&*y, x, 1);
///         ptr::copy_nonoverlapping(&t, y, 1);
///
///         // y and t now point to the same thing, but we need to completely
///         // forget `t` because we do not want to run the destructor for `T`
///         // on its value, which is still owned somewhere outside this function.
///         mem::forget(t);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Use case 3
///
/// You are transferring ownership across a [FFI] boundary to code written in
/// another language. You need to `forget` the value on the Rust side because Rust
/// code is no longer responsible for it.
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::mem;
///
/// extern "C" {
///     fn my_c_function(x: *const u32);
/// }
///
/// let x: Box<u32> = Box::new(3);
///
/// // Transfer ownership into C code.
/// unsafe {
///     my_c_function(&*x);
/// }
/// mem::forget(x);
/// ```
///
/// In this case, C code must call back into Rust to free the object. Calling C's `free`
/// function on a [`Box`][box] is *not* safe! Also, `Box` provides an [`into_raw`][into_raw]
/// method which is the preferred way to do this in practice.

///
/// It is [undefined behavior][ub] to read uninitialized memory, even just an
/// uninitialized boolean. For instance, if you branch on the value of such
/// a boolean, your program may take one, both, or neither of the branches.
///
/// Writing to the uninitialized value is similarly dangerous. Rust believes the

/// value and its fields if you try to overwrite it in a normal manner. The only way
/// to safely initialize an uninitialized value is with [`ptr::write`][write],

///
/// If the value does implement [`Drop`], it must be initialized before
/// it goes out of scope (and therefore would be dropped). Note that this
/// includes a `panic` occurring and unwinding the stack suddenly.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Here's how to safely initialize an array of [`Vec`]s.
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem;
/// use std::ptr;
///
/// // Only declare the array. This safely leaves it
/// // uninitialized in a way that Rust will track for us.
/// // However we can't initialize it element-by-element
/// // safely, and we can't use the `[value; 1000]`
/// // constructor because it only works with `Copy` data.
/// let mut data: [Vec<u32>; 1000];
///
/// unsafe {
///     // So we need to do this to initialize it.
///     data = mem::uninitialized();
///
///     // DANGER ZONE: if anything panics or otherwise
///     // incorrectly reads the array here, we will have
///     // Undefined Behavior.
///
///     // It's ok to mutably iterate the data, since this
///     // doesn't involve reading it at all.
///     // (ptr and len are statically known for arrays)
///     for elem in &mut data[..] {
///         // *elem = Vec::new() would try to drop the
///         // uninitialized memory at `elem` -- bad!
///         //
///         // Vec::new doesn't allocate or do really
///         // anything. It's only safe to call here
///         // because we know it won't panic.
///         ptr::write(elem, Vec::new());
///     }
///
///     // SAFE ZONE: everything is initialized.
/// }
///
/// println!("{:?}", &data[0]);
/// ```
///
/// This example emphasizes exactly how delicate and dangerous using `mem::uninitialized`
/// can be. Note that the [`vec!`] macro *does* let you initialize every element with a
/// value that is only [`Clone`], so the following is semantically equivalent and
