//! # The Rust core allocation library
//!
//! This is the lowest level library through which allocation in Rust can be
//! performed.
//!
//! This library, like libcore, is not intended for general usage, but rather as
//! a building block of other libraries. The types and interfaces in this
//! library are reexported through the [standard library](../std/index.html),
//! and should not be used through this library.
//!
//! Currently, there are four major definitions in this library.
//!
//! ## Boxed values
//!
//! The [`Box`](boxed/index.html) type is a smart pointer type. There can
//! only be one owner of a `Box`, and the owner can decide to mutate the
//! contents, which live on the heap.
//!
//! This type can be sent among threads efficiently as the size of a `Box` value
//! is the same as that of a pointer. Tree-like data structures are often built
//! with boxes because each node often has only one owner, the parent.
//!
//! ## Reference counted pointers
//!
//! The [`Rc`](rc/index.html) type is a non-threadsafe reference-counted pointer
//! type intended for sharing memory within a thread. An `Rc` pointer wraps a
//! type, `T`, and only allows access to `&T`, a shared reference.
//!
//! This type is useful when inherited mutability (such as using `Box`) is too
//! constraining for an application, and is often paired with the `Cell` or
//! `RefCell` types in order to allow mutation.
//!
//! ## Atomically reference counted pointers
//!
//! The [`Arc`](arc/index.html) type is the threadsafe equivalent of the `Rc`
//! type. It provides all the same functionality of `Rc`, except it requires
//! that the contained type `T` is shareable. Additionally, `Arc<T>` is itself
//! sendable while `Rc<T>` is not.
//!
//! This types allows for shared access to the contained data, and is often
//! paired with synchronization primitives such as mutexes to allow mutation of
//! shared resources.
//!
//! ## Heap interfaces
//!
//! The [`heap`](heap/index.html) module defines the low-level interface to the
//! default global allocator. It is not compatible with the libc allocator API.

// Do not remove on snapshot creation. Needed for bootstrap. (Issue #22364)
