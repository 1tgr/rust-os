/// A trait for borrowing data.
///
/// In general, there may be several ways to "borrow" a piece of data.  The
/// typical ways of borrowing a type `T` are `&T` (a shared borrow) and `&mut T`
/// (a mutable borrow). But types like `Vec<T>` provide additional kinds of
/// borrows: the borrowed slices `&[T]` and `&mut [T]`.
///
/// When writing generic code, it is often desirable to abstract over all ways
/// of borrowing data from a given type. That is the role of the `Borrow`
/// trait: if `T: Borrow<U>`, then `&U` can be borrowed from `&T`.  A given
/// type can be borrowed as multiple different types. In particular, `Vec<T>:
/// Borrow<Vec<T>>` and `Vec<T>: Borrow<[T]>`.

/// work with general borrowed data via the `Borrow` trait.
///
/// `Cow` implements `Deref`, which means that you can call

/// is desired, `to_mut` will obtain a mutable reference to an owned
/// value, cloning if necessary.
